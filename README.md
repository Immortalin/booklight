[Booklight](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/booklight/lkdhojpobehkcldjmileiancjjpdeakk)
==========

I got fed up wasting my time trying to navigate my way through bunch of bookmarks folder to arrange them. So if you are:
- Obsessed with organization
- Have a couple hundreds (or thousands) of folders in your bookmarks
- You like to keep things tidy and every page has to be in its "perfect" place

then you came to the right place. **Booklight** is a clean Chrome Extension to ease the way of adding a bookmark. 

To Launch press (ctrl/Control + b) and thats it !

### Features
- Filter bookmarks based on manual entry
- Show the path of the current selected folder
- Navigate easily through the folders tree using keyboard
    - if the folder is highlighted in blue this means that it contains sub-folders as well. The right arrow (->) keyboard key will go inside that folder. You can go back one step to the back using the left keyboard arrow (<-)
- Bookmark directly when you find your target

### Things i would like to do
- Add mouse interactions
- Add better logic to the star icon (at the moment it only shows when the page is successfully bookmarked) but it will not update if remove the bookmark ... etc.
- Add fuzzy search for filtering from input box
- Smart folder suggestions
- Remember last location when going back to main screen or removing filters
